Google Ping
===========

Google Maps Hackathon Project

On tap will calculate the the nearest amenities and calculate the bird's flight distance to each.<br/>
On long-press will display a table-view page (with hard-coded data).

### To-Do
+ Fix index out of bounds error when clicking on a location that doesn't have all amenities
+ Make the table-view page pull in actual data

### Common Errors
+ Double-check your build settings to follow [this](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/start) guide.
+ Register your own Google IOS API Key (the one in this project has been disabled for obvious reasons)
  - Google Places API Permission
  - Google Maps Permission
